=========

About news feed
    -> In news feed, async google API call is handled using redux thunk.
    -> LoremIpsum is a stateless component used to display static context to fill news brief.
    -> Loading and Pagination are handled from 'NEWS_FEED' action payload.

Library files included:
----------------------
React, Redux, Redux-Thunk, Enzyme


Components
==========

1. App.js           - App component is the initial component which will include two components Feed and FeedDetails

2. Feed.js          - Feed component will load the top 5 google news API, this will be the left side pane which highlights the news and is clickable. Component is customized to show Image, news title and news description. It also includes pagination to load next 5 stories.

3. FeedDetails.js   - FeedDetails component will be empty initially, when the user click on any news feed from Feed component the brief details of the news will be displayed in this right side pane. When user clicks on view more button the Id param will be set -1 to display no value.

4. LoremIpsum.js    - LoremIpsum is a stateless component I have used here. Since google news API i'm using here is a developer version the news details will not be displayed fully, so i have placed lorem ipsum context to get a news detail look.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
